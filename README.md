# Mechanical-Pong
### A giant, wall-mounted, mechanical version of PONG Classic
Basically a big, flat robot you can put on your wall, this project uses Arduinos, 3D printer electronics, and commonly available hardware to create a 2-player mechanical representation of a videogame classic.

This repository contains the code for the main game controller as well as the two wireless player controllers. The main base code is intended to be run on Teensy 3.x boards, but the wireless transmitter programs can be used with any Arduino-compatible microcontroller.
